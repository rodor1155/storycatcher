## üìÅ Project Structure

### üéØ Active Files (Production)
```
index.html              # Main homepage with all functionality
css/style.css          # Complete styling with child-friendly design
js/main.js             # Main functionality with static data
MANUAL-EDITING-GUIDE.md # Comprehensive content editing guide
README.md              # This documentation
```

### üìã Legacy Files (Not Used in Production)
```
admin.html             # Database-driven admin panel (GitHub Pages incompatible)
js/admin.js           # Admin functionality (requires server-side database)
```

## üìñ Content Management Approach

**Current Method: Manual HTML Editing** ‚úÖ

After discovering GitHub Pages limitations with database-driven admin systems, we've implemented a static data approach:

### ‚úÖ How It Works
- **Episodes, clans, and locations** are stored as JavaScript arrays in `js/main.js`
- **Content editing** is done directly in the source code
- **No database required** - everything works on GitHub Pages
- **Version controlled** - all changes tracked in Git
- **Fast and reliable** - no server-side dependencies

### üìö Content Editing Guide
See **[MANUAL-EDITING-GUIDE.md](./MANUAL-EDITING-GUIDE.md)** for complete instructions on:
- Adding new episodes with magical storylines
- Creating new clan stones with unique powers
- Adding London locations with magical descriptions
- Managing images and media content
- Testing and publishing changes
