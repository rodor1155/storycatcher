## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Files to Upload to Your Web Server

Upload these **4 essential files**:

```
📁 Your Website Directory/
├── 📄 simple-admin.html          # Main admin interface
└── 📁 js/
    ├── 📄 simple-admin.js         # Core admin functionality  
    ├── 📄 api-helpers.js          # Multi-user API functions
    └── 📄 database-init.js        # Database setup (NEW)
```

### First-Time Setup Steps

1. **Upload the files** to your web server/hosting
2. **Open simple-admin.html** in your browser
3. **Login** with password: `hiddenworld2024`
4. **Wait for "Database initialized"** message (first visit only)
5. **Start creating content!** ✨

## 🔧 What Happens on First Visit

### Automatic Database Setup
- System checks if database tables exist
- If not found, creates tables automatically
- Populates with sample content (3 episodes, 5 clans, 3 locations)

This is normal on first visit! The system will:
1. Show "Setting up database for first use..."
2. Create all required tables automatically
3. Refresh the page when complete
4. Content will load normally

### If Setup Doesn't Complete
1. **Refresh the page** - initialization continues
2. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
3. **Ensure all 4 files** are uploaded to correct locations
4. **Verify file permissions** allow web server access

### If You Have Existing localStorage Content
